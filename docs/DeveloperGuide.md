## **Introduction** ##

HR Manger is a simple to use and easy to learn local desktop application that allows you to easily manage your candidates, positions and interviews.
HR Manager is built on Java and can be run on all major desktop operating systems. HR Manager has a graphic user interface to display information and uses text-based commands to interact with the application.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Purpose** ##

The purpose of this guide is to provide a comprehensive documentation of the design and overview of the application for developers to quickly onboard and develop the applciation.

You can read the entire guide from teh start, which will give you a complete view of the structure of HR Manager.

Alternatively, you can quickly get started by through the [Setting Up](setting-up-getting-started) and [Design](design) to get a overview of the application.
You can then read the [Feature Implementation](feature-implementation) for more details of specific features.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Setting up, getting started**


*HR Manager* is a desktop application built with JavaFX GUI which aims to help with the HR management in small companies. With the application, the user will be able to easily manage their candidates, job postings, and interview sessions.

To set up the application, please refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `HrManagerParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `HrManagerParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCandidateCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCandidateCommand`) which the `HrManagerParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
    * Most significantly, the ArgumentTokeniser is used to parse the arguments using the provided prefixes to retrieve the inputs from the user
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCandidateCommandParser`, `DeletePositionCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="612" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the HR Manager data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="1100" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both HR Manager data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `HrManagerStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Feature Implementation** ##

### **Find Commands** ###

The `find_c`, `find_p` and `find_i` command allows users to search for candidates, positions and interviews using their parameters.
Generally, they are called `find_x` in this section

The class structure of an execution of `find_x` command is as follows. Only important classes are shown
![Structure of the find_x command](images/FindClassDiagram.png)

The `FindXCommandPredicate` holds the parsed arguments from the command and a `test` method to check if X fufils the condition

The sequence diagram of a `find_x` command execution is as follows

Firstly, the parsing of the command and argument occurs as follows
![Parse_sequence_of_find_x](images/FindParseSequenceDiagram.png)

Continuing the previous diagram, the FindXCommand is executed, and the UI is updated
![Execute_sequence_of_find_x](images/FindExecuteSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations ####
Aspect: Logical operators and combinations for find fields
* Alternative 1: AND between separate fields and OR within multiple entries in same field
    * eg: `find_c name=alex brad phone=12345678` === `(phone=12345678) AND (name contains alex OR brad)`
    * Pros: Easy to implement, simple command format for the most common usecase
    * Cons: Unable to search using more complex combination of logical operators
* Alternative 2: Allow users to specify which operators are used and how they are combined
    * Pros: Give granular control to the user for find
    * Cons: Very complex command format


### **List Commands** ###

The `list_c`, `list_p` and `list_i` command allows users to list all candidates, positions and interviews in the respective display panel.
Generally, they are called `list_x` in this section

The class structure of an execution of `list_x` command is as follows. Only important classes are shown

![Structure of the list_x command](images/ListClassDiagram.png)

The `ListXCommandPredicate` uses the preset predicate such that all X fulfills the condition.

The sequence diagram of a `list_x` command execution is as follows

Firstly, the parsing of the command and argument occurs as follows

![Parse_sequence_of_list_x](images/ListParseSequenceDiagram.png)

Continuing the previous diagram, the ListXCommand is executed, and the corresponding X panel in the UI is updated

![Execute_sequence_of_list_x](images/ListExcecuteSequenceDiagram.png)

### **Edit Commands** ###

The `edit_c`, `edit_p` and `edit_i` commands allow users to edit a specific candidate, position
or interview in the respective display panel.

Generally, they are called `edit_x` in this section.

The edit mechanism is facilitated by `editXDescriptor`, where X is the object to be edited, for example
`editPersonDescriptor` for editing candidates, `editPositionDescriptor` for editing positions, and
`editinterviewDescriptor` for editing interviews, and each non-empty field value will replace the corresponding
field value of the object that is being edited. `editXDescriptor` stores the details to edit the candidate,
position or interview with. `editXCommand` extends `Command` and implements the
`Command#execute()` operation, which executes the command and returns a result message to be displayed.

Similar to any other command, the `Command#execute()` operation is exposed in the `Logic` interface as
`Logic#execute()`. Please refer to the 'Logic component' under 'Design' for information on how the `Logic`
component works when a command is executed.

As an example, the parsing and execution of an edit_p command is as follows

![Execute_sequence_of_edit_x](images/EditPositionSequenceDiagram.png)

### **Add commands** ###

The `add_c`, `add_p` and `add_i` commands allow users to add a candidate, position
or interview in the respective display panel.

Generally, they are called `add_x` in this section. I will also be using X to represent a candidate, position or interview here.

The add_x functionality is facilitated by  `ModelManager`. It uses the following operation of `ModelManager`.
- `ModelManager#hasX` â€” Check if the candidate, position or interview already exists within Hr Manager. If so, `CommandException` will be thrown.

- `ModelManager#addX()` â€” Adds a candidate, position or interview to Hr Manager. If that position already exists, a
  `DuplicatePositionException` will be thrown.

`AddXCommandParser` and `AddXCommand` are created to achieve this functionality.
![Class_diagram_of_add_x](images/AddPosition/AddPositionClassDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and the workflow of the`add_x` command.

Step 1. The user executes command `add_x...`.
`Ui` component reads the command as a string from user's input. After that, `MainWindow`
passes the string to `LogicManager` to manipulate the command.

Step 2. `LogicManager` passes the command to `HrManagerParser` to parse the command. Since the command starts
with `add_x`, a new `AddXCommandParser` is created to parse the command further.

Step 3. `AddXCommandParser` uses `ArgumentMultimap` to tokenize the prefixes part the command. After extracting the
information of the object such as the title of a position or the name of a candidate, a new `X` is created and a new
`AddXCommand` is created with that `X`.

Step 4. `AddXCommand` passes the given `X` to `ModelManager#hasX`. If the position does not exist in the app, `AddXCommand`
passes the `Position` to `ModelManager#addPosition()`.

Step 5. `Modelmanager#addX()` updates the respective list with the new added `X`.

To better illustrate this example, the parsing and execution of an add_p command is as follows
![Execute_sequence_of_add_p](images/AddPosition/AddPositionSequence.png)
