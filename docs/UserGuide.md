### Feature: Storage
Save all candidatesâ€™ records into a data file locally, on your device itself.

When a candidate is added, edited or deleted, the change will be done accordingly in the local save file in real time.

The data will be saved as `/data/candidates.json` and `/data/interviews.json` (coming soon).

By replacing it with another save file with the same name, 
the data will be loaded accordingly into the application, if the data format is valid.

The candidates' information will be saved using the JSON format below.
For example,
```
 [{
  "name" : "Charlotte Oliveiro",
  "phone" : "93210283",
  "email" : "charlotte@example.com",
  "address" : "Blk 11 Ang Mo Kio Street 74, #11-04",
  "remark" : "",
  "tagged" : [ "rejected" ]
 }]
